##ABOUT THE PERMISSION
_"...Can observe the text you type and actions you do..."_
Alas! It's threatening isn't it? Torchie needs permission to listen to your physical hardware (volume Button) Key presses only.
What if your phone has a physical hardware Keyboard phone? Torchie can listen to text - keys you type right? So, Android shows this. But, recent Android phones (except Blackberry Priv) does not have a physical hardware Keyboard (for typing) with only three hardware physical keys i.e. one power button and two volume buttons. Actually, It is a flaw in Android showing this buggy permission!

Then Torchie cannot see Software keyboard usage? Yes. Torchie cannot see any text you type in Software keyboard because (see official Android site about KeyEvent : http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html) the default software keyboard will never send any key event to any application targeting Jelly Bean or later, and will only send some events of the delete and return key presses to applications targeting Ice Cream Sandwich or 'earlier'.

I've made a detailed FAQ here: https://torchieapp.wordpress.com/help

Also, Torchie does not have 'Internet Permission'. So it's impossible to send anything to anyone!


####NOTE: 
1. _For Android 4.0.3 ICS, 4.1 JB, 4.2 JB users ONLY_
Flashlight / torch / LED may turn on if you swipe to change volume in volume Panel. (**Tip:** Disable for screen on)
2. _Screen off will not work by default_
Torchie functionality is disabled by default in screen off, to prevent battery drain. Using in lock screen will not cause/accelerate battery drain. Advice is that using in lock screen is handy
